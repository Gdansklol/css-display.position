# CSS Display & Position

# CSS Display & Position

- You have the default **static** position.
- You have the **relative** position, which works just like static, but you can move it based on itself.
- **Absolute** positioning works just like relative, but it's moved based on its parent element that is using `position: relative`.
- **Sticky** positioning works like a combination of fixed and relative.
- **Fixed** positioning keeps an element in a fixed position on the page, so it'll stay there no matter where the user scrolls.

# CSS Display & Position

- The default position is **static**, meaning the element is positioned in the normal document flow.
- The **relative** position works like static, but you can move the element relative to its original position using `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom`.
- **Absolute** positioning moves the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element with `position: relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`).
- **Sticky** positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is relative until it crosses a specific point, after which it becomes fixed.
- **Fixed** positioning keeps an element in place relative to the viewport, regardless of scrolling. The element remains fixed at the specified position on the page.
